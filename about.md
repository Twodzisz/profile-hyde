<p class="message">
  My name is Tim Wodzisz and I am currently a senior attending the University of Iowa. I have spent the last four years studying journalism and sports, two of my favorite topics. I grew up in Chicago and because of that I am a die hard chicago sports fan. I hope to someday bring my passion for sports and journalism together and make a career out of it.

I believe that my previous experiences in the work world have helped turn me into a trustworthy and loyal person with keen leadership skills. Together those qualities help me rise in the workplace. My work hard, play hard mentality helps make the working environment fun yet very task oriented. I continue to be learn and better as a person living in society.
