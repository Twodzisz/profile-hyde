"Those who don't jump will never fly"

I'm a member of the University of Iowa [School of Journalism and Mass Communication](http://clas.uiowa.edu/sjmc/) Class of 2016.

I have proven expertise in [multimedia storytelling](/), [journalistic reporting and writing](/#) and [media law](/#). I am currently in the journalism program at the University of Iowa, and I will be seeking a full time job come 2017.

My time in school has taught me a magnitude of different life lessons that will help me when transitioning into the real world. I would like to take what I have learned and apply it towards some sort of job involving both journalism and professional sports. It has been a dream of mine ever since I was little to someday work for ESPN.
